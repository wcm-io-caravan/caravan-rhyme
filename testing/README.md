This module contains some additional classes only to be used in **test** scope.

# Usage

These classes are mostly meant for internal use in the other integration packages, but they may also be useful for your own integration tests.

If you want to use them in your project, you should make sure to add this module as a **test** scope dependency only, because it does contain code and other dependencies
that you don't want in your classpath at runtime of your application.
