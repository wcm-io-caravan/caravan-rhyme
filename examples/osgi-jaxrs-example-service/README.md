======
# Summary

This is an example for using RxJava3 reactive types in your HAL API interface, and implement those interfaces in an OSGi R7 container using the JAX-RS Whiteboard 
and Rhyme's [OSGI / JAX-RS Integration](/integration/osgi-jaxrs) bundle.

# Usage

The service can be launched using the [OSGI JAX-RS Example Launchpad](/examples/osgi-jaxrs-example-launchpad) (which also contains the integration tests)
